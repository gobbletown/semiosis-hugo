## Introducing <span class="underline">LookingGlass</span> {#introducing}

Source code

`LookingGlass` is an imaginary-web (ùëñweb)
browser. It allows lets you visit websites that do
not exist concretely, and also also allows you
to treat any text as having hyperlinks.

An imaginary-web browser requires a LM such as
GPT-3, Codex or GPT-j to generate websites and
is designed to provide the means to surf the
imagination of the AI through the guise of a
web-browser interface.

It's a very practical tool that [as an example]
lets you create tutorials for topics that have
not had somebody explicitly create tutorials
for, and allows you to infer what might be
behind the 404, if you come across a website
which has been taken down.
