## Perspective {#perspective}


### Stories will auto-complete one day {#stories-will-auto-complete-one-day}

By this, I mean, if I place an incomplete
story on GitHub, this will autocomplete one
day because an AGI will go looking for it,
find it on GitHub and publish the completed
version somewhere, but I can be working on it
now, if I want.

Therefore, I must focus on connecting things
to sources of immutable truth.
