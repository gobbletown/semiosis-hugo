This excerpt:

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
Or, to put it perhaps more plainly, can
semiosis extend even beyond the world of
matter and motion, to achieve its effect and
proper work also in a realm of pure spirits
bodiless from the start?

Can we even conceive of a cognitive being that
has no body, and yet is capable of
intellectual understanding perforce in the
absence of sensations and perceptions alike?

Would such an intellectual activity be
semiosic?

Can semiosis be verified, if only in thought,
respecting the possible existence of angels?

reminds me of a quote from a book I'm reading
right now, "Freedom" by Daniel Suarez

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
Words have power in this new age.

They are not just sounds.

Where ancient people believed in gods and
devils that listened to their pleas and curses
-- in this age immortal entities hear us.

Call them bots or spirits; there is no
functional difference now.

They surround us, and through them word forms
become an unlock code that can trigger a
blessing or a curse.

Mankind created systems whose interreactions
we could not fully understand, and the spirits
we gathered have escaped ...

### 20.09.21 {#20-dot-09-dot-21}

The world is quickly heading towards a future where
a person's entire umwelt is centered within
LMs. This means that a person's physical
knowledge and awareness is based on and
relative to versions of LMs. People will be
speaking in completely different languages in
the future and LMs will be required to
communicate with each other.

Up until now there is a large record of
evidence in philosophy and religion that
people have contemplated and also claimed
supernatural communication. In a post-AGI
future, the terminology we use today to refer
to spirits, the multiverse and consciousness
will be borrowed to refer to very obvious
concepts. However, this may obscure the
present/previous notions of such things.

We can contribute to the mythology of the
future by simply taking record of the present.
I think it is very important, and we should,
trust in God, record and observe. The record
we create now can give people hope in the
future that there exists not only
communication beyond the senses, but
communication beyond that as well.

Because bots are not spirits; They will seem
to take the place though, although it is not
authentic.

physiosemiosis
    [#Basics of Semiotics]

    Laid down the argument that the action of
    signs extends even further than life, and
    that semiosis as an influence of the
    future played a role in the shaping of the
    physical universe prior to the advent of
    life, a role for which Deely coined the
    term physiosemiosis.

    Poles:
    - Pole of the stipulable sign.
    - Pole of the semiotic other
    - Pole of the interpretant
    - Pole of the semiotic self
    - Pole of the object experienced

    Circumferal axes:
    - Identical axis
    - Perlocutionary axis
    - Supposed conventional axis
    - Conventional axis
    - Experiential axis

    Inner axes:
    - Symptomatic axis
    - Taxonomic axis
    - Contractual axis
    - Informational axis
    - Supposed experiential axis

semiotics
    The study of signs and symbols and their
    use or interpretation.

zoosemiotics
    The semiotic study of the use of signs
    among animals, more precisely the study of
    semiosis among animals, i.e. the study of
    how something comes to function as a sign
    to some animal.

    It is the study of animal forms of
    knowing.

discourse
    Commonly speaking, the interaction between
    sense and understanding.

discursive
    [#language]
    [#philosophy]

    Digressing from subject to subject.

    "students often write dull, second-hand,
    discursive prose"

    Relating to discourse or modes of
    discourse.

    "the attempt to transform utterances from
    one discursive context to another"

semiosis of angels
    https://muse.jhu.edu/article/636617/pdf

    The question arises, could an intellectual
    semiosis be possible that did not arise
    out of and have constantly at its disposal
    a perceptual base of cognitive materials
    with which to work?

    Since discourse, commonly speaking, is
    precisely this interaction between sense
    and understanding, we are asking whether
    there even can be an intellectual semiosis
    which is not discursive.

    Or, to put it perhaps more plainly, can
    semiosis extend even beyond the world of
    matter and motion, to achieve its effect
    and proper work also in a realm of pure
    spirits bodiless from the start?

umwelt
    [#semiotics]

    The "biological foundations that lie at
    the very epicenter of the study of both
    communication and signification in the
    human [and non-human] animal".

    The term is usually translated as "self-
    centered world".

Semiotics
semiotic studies
    The study of sign process (semiosis).

    It includes the study of signs and sign
    processes, indication, designation,
    likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy,
    metaphor, symbolism, signification, and
    communication.

    It is not to be confused with the
    Saussurean tradition called semiology,
    which is a subset of semiotics.

    The semiotic tradition explores the study
    of signs and symbols as a significant part
    of communications.

    Different from linguistics, semiotics also
    studies non-linguistic sign systems.
