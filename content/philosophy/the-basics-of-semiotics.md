semiosis
    It is important to understand what I mean
    by semiosis.

    All dynamical action, or action of brute
    force, physical or psychical, either takes
    place between two subjects (whether they
    react equally upon each other, or one is
    agent and the other patient, entirely or
    partially) or at any rate is a resultant
    of such actions between pairs.

    But by “semiosis” I mean, on the contrary,
    an action, or influence, which is, or
    involves, a coöperation of three subjects,
    such as a sign, its object, and its
    interpretant, this tri-relative influence
    not being in any way resolvable into
    actions between pairs.

## Summary {#summary}

I found this book refreshing after having been
engrossing myself in books and videos to do
with Noam Chomsky's perspectives on language.

The reason is that communication, though it
may be separated from language, is a topic
that demands as much inquiring, in my opinion,
as I am more puzzled and intrigued by the
study of language and communication outside of
human beings, including artificial
intelligences, other biological lifeforms and
potetentially aliens.

It's a good book. I'll continue reading it.
