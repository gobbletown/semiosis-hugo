## The mind is the <span class="underline">master manufacturer</span> {#the-mind-is-the}

-   who divides the work to be executed into different processes.
-   modules in the mind
    -   reasoning ability
    -   spatial skills
    -   language
    -   etc.

## The <span class="underline">biological bush</span> {#the}

-   'As for humans, we are unquestionably a pure product of a certain aridity', it has been
    claimed (Coppens 1994: 69). After the catastrophe, our ape cousins were left in the lush
    and pleasant tree-terrain of the humid west. Our own ancestors were stranded in a
    relatively treeless savannah in the increasingly dry east, where they were forced to adapt,
    or die. An unfavourable climate forced a deprived species to live on its wits and, in the
    long run, develop language.

## The requirements for development of language {#the-requirements-for-development-of-language}


### <span class="underline">social structure</span> and <span class="underline">intimate interaction</span> {#}

-   <span class="underline">guessing and gossip</span>, not <span class="underline">grooming in groups</span>: _Gossip_ rather than _grooming_ might
    have been promoted by several factors.

    ..language is an intimate type of
    interaction, better at close quarters than
    across vast spaces. But group size alone may
    not be particularly important, and bands of
    150 may have occurred earlier, with no
    language development (Hyland 1993). The
    quality of the interactions matters more
    than overall numbers: the bleating of sheep
    might turn into language if herd-size alone
    was crucial.

    Spoken language leaves the hands free for
    other activities, perhaps important in open
    savannah where humans possibly lived at one
    time (chapter 5). Sounds can be heard in the
    dark, and messages can be transmitted
    rapidly.

phatic expression
phatic communication
    [#linguistics]

    A phatic expression is communication which
    serves a social function, such as social
    pleasantries that don't seek or offer
    information of intrinsic value but can
    signal willingness to observe conventional
    local expectations for politeness.

### <span class="underline">man of many wiles</span> / <span class="underline">dogs may dissemble</span> {#}

T. H. Huxley
: A man has no reason to
    be ashamed of having an ape for his
    grandfather. If there were an ancestor whom
    I should feel shame in recalling it would
    rather be a man ... who ... plunges into
    scientific questions with which he has no
    real acquaintance. <span class="underline">only to obscure</span> them by
    an aimless rhetoric, and distract the
    attention of his hearers from the real point
    at issue by eloquent digressions and skilled
    appeals to religious prejudice.


<span class="underline">True</span> **deceit** involves <span class="underline">tactical</span> **deception**
    The extent of animal deception is only now
    becoming clear. But the deceit of dogs
    is not well-planned.: 'Acts from the
    normal repertoire of the agent, deployed
    such that another individual is likely to
    misinterpret what the acts signify, to the
    advantage of the agent' (R. W. Byrne and
    Whiten 1988, 1992: 612). Humans are very
    good at it. The ability to deceive is not
    necessarily a bad thing. This is a
    powerful skill, which may be used
    selfishly or unselfishly. To exercise it,
    it's necessary to mentally 'put oneself
    into another person's shoes'.

theory of mind
    Humans can do this: they can imagine
    alternative possible worlds, and treat others
    as if they had 'mental states'.

    Those who can represent the minds of others in
    their own minds are said to have a theory of
    mind, something possessed by all normal
    humans.

    Some can talk, but they have great difficulty
    in fully understanding other people.

    Animals who possess a theory of mind are good
    at social manipulation.

wile
    Devious or cunning stratagems employed in
    manipulating or persuading someone to do
    what one wants.
    "she didn't employ any feminine wiles to
    capture his attention"

dissemble
    Conceal or disguise one's true feelings or
    beliefs.
    "an honest, sincere person with no need to
    dissemble"

    Disguise or conceal (a feeling or
    intention).
    "she smiled, dissembling her true emotion"

mindblind
mindblindness
    A few unfortunates suffer from a puzzling
    deficit, an inability to understand
    another's point of view.

    This condition is sometimes referred to as
    'mindblindness', and it is a major symptom
    of autism.

    To 'mindblind' humans, the world is a
    confusing place which they never 'get the
    hang of'.

## <span class="underline">ruling the rules</span> {#}

-   The permitted patterns or rules of all
    languages constantly change, and new words
    are continually coming into use. Yet
    language never collapses: the rules do not
    spiral out of control. Each new generation
    of children can cope with learning their
    language. And, with a bit of effort, all
    humans can learn any other human language,
    though they are baffled when faced with the
    communication systems of other species. It's
    an odd situation when it's impossible to
    find more than a few broad language
    universals. Some principles must rule the
    rules. Language has 'hidden secrets', reins
    which keep it in check, and linguists are
    who try to find out what they are. Let us
    consider the matter further.


### <span class="underline">prohibitions vs preferences</span> {#}

-   Broadly speaking, constraints are of two
    types, filters and preferences. Filters
    close off certain possibilities
    absolutely. Such prohibitions are true
    constraints. Preferences, on the other
    hand, provide channels which are easy to
    flow along. They turn attention away from
    some non-preferred, though possible,
    routes. Such pseudoconstraints are often
    difficult to separate from prohibitions.

-   To summarize, universals and constraints
    overlap: they are opposite sides of the
    same coin. Language contains two types
    of constraints: filters (real
    constraints) and preferences
    (pseudoconstraints). And these may work
    on at least two levels: that of general
    human abilities, and that of language.

generativity
    The use of finite resources to produce an
    infinite variety of sentences

    Language has the property of generativity.

    A feature common to all languages.

absolute linguistic universal
    A feature common to all languages.

    Rare, unless one takes an over-broad view
    of the word 'universal'.

    Even when apparently found, they differ in
    details from language to language.

## Unweaving the rainbow: <span class="underline">separating the strands</span> {#unweaving-the-rainbow}

-   Language has some similarities to the
    rainbow. Both can be partially separated
    from their surroundings: the rainbow from
    the clouds, and language from a general
    ability to think (chapter 4). And both
    language and the rainbow appear to be made
    out of various strands. To a poet, chopping
    it all up might seem like pointless
    pedantry. But for linguists concerned with
    language, this is a necessity, even if the
    result is unromantic.

: - My mother ...predicted that
    -   Future rulers would conquer and control
    -   Not by strength, nor by violence,
    -   But by cunning


Umberto Eco, Foucault's pendulum
: The real
    magicician isn't the bleary-eyed guy who doesn't
    understand a thing: it's the scientist who has
    grasped the hidden secrets of the universe.

Alexander Pope, Essay on Man
: - Let earth unbalanc'd from her orbit fly,
    -   Planets and suns run lawless thro' the sky;
    -   Let ruling angels from their spheres be hurl'd,
    -   Being on being wreck'd and world on world.

C. S. Lewis, Evolutionary hymn
: - Lead us, Evolution, lead us
    -   Up the future's endless stair;
    -   Chop us, change us, prod us, weed us.
    -   For stagnation is despair:
    -   Groping, guessing, yet progressing,
    -   Lead us nobody knows where.
