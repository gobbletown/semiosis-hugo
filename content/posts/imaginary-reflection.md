imaginary reflection
    This is where a program such as a complex
    interpreter can access knowledge of its
    holographic representation via a language
    model.

holographic representation
    The embedding of the way software is used
    within a language model that has been
    trained on the usage of that software,
    whether it is usage of the final program
    or usage of its internal source code
    within itself.

    THe holographic representation of software
    encompasses the way a program's source
    code is used both within itself and also
    in the real world as modelled by a
    language model.

complex interpreter
    This is a real/ordinary interpreter with
    an interactivity layer that solicits a
    language model for imaginary reflection
    capabilities to the real program.
