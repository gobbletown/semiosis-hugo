## Summary {#summary}

I talk about some of the symbols used in
<https://semiosis.github.io/> blog articles.


## Imaginary Programming {#imaginary-programming}

Discovering the ancient symbols within LMs is
particularly exciting.

    A programming paradigm in which a computer
    program's behaviour exists in relativity to
    language models.

## ouroboros {#ouroboros}

Ouroboros, emblematic serpent of ancient Egypt
and Greece represented with its tail in its
mouth, continually devouring itself and being
reborn from itself.

A gnostic and alchemical symbol, Ouroboros
expresses the unity of all things, material
and spiritual, which never disappear but
perpetually change form in an eternal cycle of
destruction and re-creation.

A quine-relay is also known as an ouroboros
program. This has been discovered in the
prompt engineering world as an _ouroboros prompt_.

I think it would be interesting to make self-replicating
ouroboros prompts in a similar fashion to
self-replicating patterns in Conway's Game of
Life.


## chimera {#chimera}

The Chimera, also Chimaera, according to Greek
mythology, was a monstrous fire-breathing
hybrid creature of Lycia in Asia Minor,
composed of the parts of more than one animal.

It is usually depicted as a lion, with the
head of a goat protruding from its back, and a
tail that might end with a snake's head.

A chimera is essentially a single organism
that's made up of cells from two or more
"individuals"â€”that is, it contains two sets of
DNA, with the code to make two separate
organisms.

One way that chimeras can happen naturally in
humans is that a fetus can absorb its twin.

Imaginary chimeric languages are chimeras that
are created naturally upon querying a LM.
