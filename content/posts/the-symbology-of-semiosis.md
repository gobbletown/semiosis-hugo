## Summary {#summary}

I talk about some of the symbols used in
<https://semiosis.github.io/> blog articles.


## Imaginary Programming {#imaginary-programming}

Discovering the ancient symbols within LMs is
particularly exciting.

    A programming paradigm in which a computer
    program's behaviour exists in relativity to
    language models.

## ouroboros {#ouroboros}

Ouroboros, emblematic serpent of ancient Egypt
and Greece represented with its tail in its
mouth, continually devouring itself and being
reborn from itself.

A gnostic and alchemical symbol, Ouroboros
expresses the unity of all things, material
and spiritual, which never disappear but
perpetually change form in an eternal cycle of
destruction and re-creation.

A quine-relay is also known as an ouroboros
program. This has been discovered in the
prompt engineering world as an _ouroboros prompt_.

I think it would be interesting to make self-replicating
ouroboros prompts in a similar fashion to
self-replicating patterns in Conway's Game of
Life.


## chimera {#chimera}

The Chimera, also Chimaera, according to Greek
mythology, was a monstrous fire-breathing
hybrid creature of Lycia in Asia Minor,
composed of the parts of more than one animal.

It is usually depicted as a lion, with the
head of a goat protruding from its back, and a
tail that might end with a snake's head.

A chimera is essentially a single organism
that's made up of cells from two or more
"individuals"—that is, it contains two sets of
DNA, with the code to make two separate
organisms.

One way that chimeras can happen naturally in
humans is that a fetus can absorb its twin.

Imaginary chimeric languages are chimeras that
are created naturally upon querying a LM.


## hydra {#hydra}

Hydra, also called the Lernean Hydra, in Greek
legend, the offspring of Typhon and Echidna
(according to the early Greek poet Hesiod’s
Theogony), a gigantic water-snake-like monster
with nine heads (the number varies), one of
which was immortal.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/Heracles02LernaeanHydra.jpg" >}}

The monster’s haunt was the marshes of Lerna,
near Árgos, from which he periodically emerged
to harry the people and livestock of Lerna.

Anyone who attempted to behead the Hydra found
that as soon as one head was cut off, two more
heads would emerge from the fresh wound.
