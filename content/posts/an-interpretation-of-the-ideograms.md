## Summary {#summary}

Today I felt like I should try to interpret
the ideograms that make up the semiosis logo.

URL
: <https://semiosis.github.io/>

So I found my way to the linguistics section
of the library and found a book.

I realise that some of these symbols could be
attributed in other ways but this the first
interpretation I have attempted and an
interesting one at that.

-   The eclispe (end of a cycle / the world)
    -   Cross of Loraine. The first bar represents the death of Jesus while the second cross bar represents his resurrection and victory.

    -   Up-down arrow. Autumn

    -   `#` with square around it

    -   The planet Earth, variation.

    -   To mix (Alchemy)

### Interpretation {#interpretation}

It's the end of a cycle regarding the death
and resurrection of Christ.
Earth is in Autumn. _Something_ is to mix.


## The Solar eclipse - The end of a cycle {#the-solar-eclipse-the-end-of-a-cycle}

The end of a cycle.


## The Cross of Lorraine - Death and Resurrection {#the-cross-of-lorraine-death-and-resurrection}

The Cross of Lorraine, known as Cross of Anjou
in the 16th century, is a heraldic two-barred
cross, consisting of a vertical line crossed
by two shorter horizontal bars.

The first bar represents the death of Jesus
while the second cross bar represents his
resurrection and victory.
