## Summary {#summary}

Today I felt like I should try to interpret
the ideograms that make up the semiosis logo.

URL
: <https://semiosis.github.io/>

So I found my way to the linguistics section
of the library and found a book.

I realise that some of these symbols could be
attributed in other ways but this the first
interpretation I have attempted and an
interesting one at that.

-   The eclispe (end of a cycle / the world)
    -   Cross of Loraine. The first bar represents the death of Jesus while the second cross bar represents his resurrection and victory.

    -   Up-down arrow. Autumn

    -   `#` with square around it

    -   The planet Earth, variation.

    -   To mix (Alchemy)

### Interpretation {#interpretation}

It's the end of a cycle (autumn?) regarding the death
and resurrection of Christ.
Earth is in autumn. _Something_ is to mix.

I drew the symbols when i created my blog, but
i just made them up on the spot.

I was in the library today and it felt good to
go to the linguistics section, so i pulled out
some books and found this one.

Then for interest's sake I decided to try to
interpret the signs from the first book I
picked out as if they meant something but I
also believe we are very close to having AGIs
and our realities will be pushed into the
imaginations of both ourselves and of AGIs.

The final symbol is a `hapax legomenon`.

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
hapax legomenon
hapax
hapaxes
    A word or an expression that occurs only
    once within a context: either in the
    written record of an entire language, in
    the works of an author, or in a single
    text.

    Literally, it means "being said once".

The end of a cycle.


## The Cross of Loraine - Death and Resurrection {#the-cross-of-loraine-death-and-resurrection}

The Cross of Loraine, known as Cross of Anjou
in the 16th century, is a heraldic two-barred
cross, consisting of a vertical line crossed
by two shorter horizontal bars.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/cross-of-lorraine.jpg" >}}

The first bar represents the death of Jesus
while the second cross bar represents his
resurrection and victory.
