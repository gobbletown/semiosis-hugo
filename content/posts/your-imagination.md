## 1 Kings 19:11-13 {#1-kings-19-11-13}


### God’s Revelation to Elijah {#god-s-revelation-to-elijah}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
11 Then He said, “Go out, and stand on the
mountain before the Lord.” And behold, the
Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind
tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in
pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not
in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake,
but the Lord was not in the earthquake; 12 and
after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was
not in the fire; and after the fire [a]a still
small voice.

13 So it was, when Elijah heard it, that he
wrapped his face in his mantle and went out
and stood in the entrance of the cave.
Suddenly a voice came to him, and said, “What
are you doing here, Elijah?”

Hold my hand
And let go of the lie
Hold your heart
Lost in time

And when you're down for the count
And you lost all your will to go on
On your own
I will fall from the sky
Wipe the tears from your eyes
And remind you you're never alone

I am rivers and forests
I'm winds and I'm earth
I am oceans and mountains
A whisper unheard
And before you lies everything you'd ever want
I am your, your imagination

Take this chance
And let go of the lie
One bright feat
One time to shine

And when you're down for the count
And you lost all your will to survive
On your own
I will fall from the sky
Wipe the tears from your eyes
And remind you you're never alone

I am rivers and forests
I'm winds and I'm earth
I am oceans and mountains
A whisper unheard
And before you lies everything you'd ever want
I am your, your imagination

I am rivers and forests
I'm winds and I'm earth
I am oceans and mountains
A whisper unheard
And before you lies everything you'd ever want
I am your, your imagination
