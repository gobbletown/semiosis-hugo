## Summary {#summary}

I demonstrate how Codex is reversible computing.


## Janus {#janus}

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus%5F(time-reversible%5Fcomputing%5Fprogramming%5Flanguage)>

Janus is a reversible programming language,
i.e. it supports deterministic forward and
backward computation by local inversion.

A language like Janus for reversible non-
deterministic inference is sorely needed.


## Codex {#codex}

Codex is non-deterministic forward and
backward inference.

From the example `json` above, the example
`jq` below was generated, which was able to
generate the following json, an exact replica
of the original.

Code was generated from output.

{{< highlight bash "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
jq -n '{jsonrpc: "2.0", id: 2896, result: [{name: "port->", kind: 13, location: {uri: "file:///home/shane/scripts/glob-grep.rkt", range: {end: {character: 8, line: 3}, start: {character: 2, line: 3}}}}]}' | v
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight json "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}

      }
    }
  ]
}

## Reversible computing {#reversible-computing}

In another sense, the input was generated from
the output, and the program was the prompt.


### A new language is needed {#a-new-language-is-needed}

A language which enforces types is needed.
What is the type of the output? JSON. But what
does that mean?

Imagine a situation where generated output was
chimeric and had no known compiler which could
agree on its type. What is actually needed is
consensus, somehow.

Therefore, we need language detectors which we
agree on. I'm talking about LMs on the
blockchain.

A `type` would then be a prompt to that LM,
which validates the type by binary
classification. I'll call this an `imaginary type`, but the LM (the source of truth)
**should** be agreed upon, so it should be on a
blockchain.

This is why I have invested in `Ocean`.
