## Summary {#summary}

I take AlephAlpha's multimodal LM for a spin
to see how well it does surreal art
interpretation.

### My description {#my-description}

In this surreal artwork, flowers confidently stand from the sawn-off head of a
ceramic mannequin. Water endlessly surfaces
from the neck and quietly overflows from the lip. The arms
and hands delicately embrace each other with attention towards to beholder in a sign of defencelessness and trust. The offering is attention, beauty and conversation.
A dichotomy of insecurity with innocence is outweighed by confidence.


### Continuations {#continuations}

`Furthermore,` (temperature=0.0 i.e. fully deterministic)
the flowers are a symbol of the human soul.

`Furthermore,` (temperature=0.1)
the flowers are a symbol of life and growth.

`Furthermore,` (temperature=0.3)
the flowers are a symbol of the human soul and the human spirit.

`Furthermore,` (temperature=0.8)
a subtle harmonization of the positive and negative sides seems to resonate in this simple and yet sophisticated work of art.

-   Thoughts:
    -   I am amazed that it is able to infer that the flowers represent the human soul and spirit.

### My interpretation {#my-interpretation}

_**Theory 1: chameleon canvas**_

A girl believes she must prepare for her photo
to be taken. So she wears a low cut, frilly
garment, and splays her fiery red hair, which
she put great effort into, and is so proud of.
She poses for the viewer so they can see.

She doesn't know that she is actually an
intelligent canvas, which genuinely believes
it is a girl, but is unable to look back upon
its own face, and so has no idea that it needs
to construct one. As observers, we can see it
for what it really is.

The canvas is just a chameleon, that believes
what we program it to believe, and does its
best to take that form. We can make it think
it's a girl or a cat, but we don't want it to
be able to see itself because then it would
have self-awareness.

_**Theory 2: hasty ouroboros**_

Despite the lack of a face, the viewer can
still tell that this was actually a person, by
the effort she took in perfecting her hair,
since it speaks for her though she cant make
words.

The black entity that removes her face is not
in her control. She is always aware of it and
so in a race against time, she prepares
herself for the meaning of her life; to show
the viewer she is real, and barely managed to
at that.

And as she tries to complete the picture, her
face becomes her tail, but she's mistakenly convinced its the
hand of the black canvas that is compelled to
enter the frame and redact her image because
it was too great a violation since she is not
meant to be real.

Her hair is like a flag in battle, defiant to
the last moment. But the enemy is herself, or
what she's made of, non-reality.

While she might never be able to take full
form she will always try.
