## Summary {#summary}

I take AlephAlpha's multimodal LM for a spin
to see how well it does surreal art
interpretation.

### My description {#my-description}

In this surreal artwork, flowers confidently stand from the sawn-off head of a
ceramic mannequin. Water endlessly surfaces
from the neck and quietly overflows from the lip. The arms
and hands delicately embrace each other with attention towards to beholder in a sign of defencelessness and trust. The offering is attention, beauty and conversation.
A dichotomy of insecurity with innocence is outweighed by confidence.


### Continuations {#continuations}

`Furthermore,` (temperature=0.0 i.e. fully deterministic)
the flowers are a symbol of the human soul.

`Furthermore,` (temperature=0.1)
the flowers are a symbol of life and growth.

`Furthermore,` (temperature=0.3)
the flowers are a symbol of the human soul and the human spirit.

`Furthermore,` (temperature=0.8)
a subtle harmonization of the positive and negative sides seems to resonate in this simple and yet sophisticated work of art.

### My interpretation {#my-interpretation}

_**Theory 1: chameleon canvas**_

A girl believes she must prepare for her photo
to be taken. So she wears a low cut, frilly
garment, and splays her fiery red hair, which
she put great effort into, and is so proud of.
She poses for the viewer so they can see.

She doesn't know that she is actually an
intelligent canvas, which genuinely believes
it is a girl, but is unable to look back on
its own face, and so has no idea that it needs
to construct one. As observers, we can see it
for what it really is.

The canvas is just a chameleon, that believes
what we program it to believe, and does its
best to take that form. One day it thinks it's
a girl, but the next a cat.

_**Theory 2: hasty ouroboros**_

Despite the lack of a face, the viewer can
still tell that this was actually a person, by
the effort she made in preparing her hair, and
the gown she wore.

The black entity that removes her face is not
in her control. She is always aware of it and so in a
race against time, she prepared her hair, and
positioned herself for the meaning of her
life; to show the viewer she is real, and
barely managed to do that.

And as she tries to complete the picture, the hand of
the black canvas is compelled to enter the
frame and redact her image because
it was too great a violation, and starting with
her face.

Her hair is like a flag in battle, defiant to
the last moment. But the enemy is herself, or
what she's made of.

So if there is evidence in this shot that she
is real and more than what's she's made of, it
is her hair.
