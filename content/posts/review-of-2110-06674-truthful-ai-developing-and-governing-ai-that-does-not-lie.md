## Summary {#summary}

This is my notebook as I go through this paper.

Original article
: [ 2110.06674  Truthful AI: Developing and governing AI that does not lie](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06674)


Truth
: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth>

I have not yet read the paper, but this page will serve as my notes for it.


## Initial thoughts {#initial-thoughts}

An institution, even a benevolent one, reminds
me of The Ministry of Truth from 1984. An
institution is better than anarchy, in my
opinion, but I still think that decentralised
governance, such as from a blockchain is a
better algorithm. Perhaps the Future of Life
Institute could create such a benevolent
blockchain for the dissemination of power over
what is true.


## Types of truth {#types-of-truth}

This is a work-in-progress.

| Types          | Mentioned   | Other Possible candidates              |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Correspondence |             |                                        |
| Coherence      |             | Language model                         |
| Pragmatic      |             | Interrogating language model           |
| Constructivist | Institution | Blockchain for training data accretion |
| Consensus      |             | Blockchain for trained models          |
| Deflationary   |             |                                        |
| Performative   |             |                                        |


### No mention of blockchain {#no-mention-of-blockchain}

Here are my previous notes on base-truth via language models on the blockchain.
