This is my notebook as I go through this paper.

Original article
: [ 2110.06674  Truthful AI: Developing and governing AI that does not lie](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06674)


Truth

I have not yet read the paper, but this page will serve as my notes for it.


## Types of truth {#types-of-truth}

This is a work-in-progress.

| Types          | Mentioned   | Other Possible candidates              |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|

| Coherence      |             | Language model                         |
| Pragmatic      |             | Interrogating language model           |
| Constructivist | Institution | Blockchain for training data accretion |
| Consensus      |             | Blockchain for trained models          |
