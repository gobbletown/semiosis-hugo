** What is Pen.el?
=Pen.el= stands for _Prompt Engineering in Emacs_.
It's an IDE for Prompt-Engineering, a new type of programming, and the
project integrates functions based on prompts (i.e. prompt functions) into
emacs. Emacs is a human-designed, intelligible user interface
with its initial version in 1976. Therefore,
the user interface has been maturing for over 45 years.
=Pen.el= takes advantage of this epic legacy
of UI design to frame LMs in a powerful way to the user.

** Introduction
As a beginner, to get started I would aim to
simply set up the =pen= standalone
application, which will provide you with most functionality via a docker container.

This enables you do use =pen= without
integrating it tightly into your own emacs, whereby you can still use the prompting functions in a
basic way; The thin-client prompting function names all start with =pen-fn-=
and the names of the fully-featured prompting functions all begin with =pf-=.

But you will not be able to use the =ilambda=
functions, or get the full Pen experience without
integrating =Pen.el= into your main emacs
configuration.

However, if you're going to test out =pen= and
plan on only setting up the standalone
application along with the thin-client, you'll
still be able to use the following
applications:

| Application name       | Script name  | Purpose                              | URL                                       |
|------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| =Apostrophe=           | =apostrophe= | Imaginary conversation               | https://semiosis.github.io/apostrophe/    |
| =LookingGlass=         | =lg=         | Imaginary-Web Browser                | https://semiosis.github.io/looking-glass/ |
| =Paracosm=             | =cosm=       | AI-Assisted Mind-map                 | https://semiosis.github.io/paracosm/      |
| =ComplexTerm=          | =ct=         | Real+Imaginary Terminal Multiplexer  | https://semiosis.github.io/cterm/         |
| =ImaginaryInterpreter= | =ii=         | Fully imaginary language interpreter | https://semiosis.github.io/ii/            |
| =pen bash interop=     | =penf=       | Prompt function interface for bash   | [[https://semiosis.github.io/posts/pen-el-host-interop-and-client-server/][Pen.el host interop]]                       |
| =NLÂ·SH=                | =nlsh=       | Natural Language Shell               | https://semiosis.github.io/nlsh/          |

They are accessible by running the script name
on the host (or inside the container shell, if
you prefer).

** Initial setup
These instructions are designed for a linux
distribution with docker installed.

You will need at bare minimum an OpenAI key, AI21 key or Cohere key.

# #+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code
#   echo "<aix key here>" > ~/.pen/aix_api_key                # https://aixsolutionsgroup.com/
# #+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i false :async :results verbatim code
  git clone "https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el"
  git clone "https://github.com/semiosis/prompts"
  git clone "https://github.com/semiosis/engines"
  git clone "https://github.com/semiosis/pen-contrib.el"

  mkdir -p ~/.pen

  # Put in your keys, or do not, it's up to you! Get your free keys from the following URLs
  echo "sk-<openai key here>" > ~/.pen/openai_api_key       # https://openai.com/
  echo "<ai21 key here>" > ~/.pen/ai21_api_key              # https://www.ai21.com/
  echo "<hf key here>" > ~/.pen/hf_api_key                  # https://huggingface.co/
  echo "<nlpcloud key here>" > ~/.pen/nlpcloud_api_key      # https://nlpcloud.io/
  echo "<alephalpha key here>" > ~/.pen/alephalpha_api_key  # https://aleph-alpha.de/
  echo "<cohere key here>" > ~/.pen/cohere_api_key          # https://cohere.ai/

  # Add the scripts to the PATH
  echo export PATH="$(realpath .)/pen.el/scripts:\$PATH" >> ~/.profile

  # Add this to prevent C-s from freezing the terminal
  echo "stty stop undef 2>/dev/null; stty start undef 2>/dev/null" | tee -a ~/.zshrc >> ~/.bashrc

  # Source your .profile
  . ~/.profile

  # Run pen - This will start 'pen' emacs inside of a docker container.
  pen
#+END_SRC

*** Force the engine
If you have an =OpenAI= key, then most
prompts/features/applications will simply
work without further setup. If you don't have an OpenAI key, but
have another key such as =AI21= then you can
force all prompts to use the key you have.

I will demonstrate forcing Pen.el to use the =Cohere= engine for everything.
This is useful if you only have a Cohere key.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  # Run this on your host machine
  pen config
#+END_SRC

Ensure this is enabled:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  (setq pen-prompt-force-engine-disabled t)
#+END_SRC

And this is set:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  (setq pen-force-engine "Cohere")
#+END_SRC

You may also set these values in this file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  vim ~/.pen/pen.yaml
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html

#+END_EXPORT

*** You can use it like a regular editor
This way, it will create a hardlink to the
file, so emacs in the docker container can
access it.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  pen yas.el 
#+END_SRC

** Basic demo
*** This is prompting
#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code
  echo "Q: 'Why did the chicken cross the road?' A: '" | pen-prompt | head -n 1 | sed "s/'.*//"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src bash
To get to the other side.
#+end_src

*** Pen.el thin client
- [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/thin-client-for-pen-el-just-load-pen-client-el/][Thin-client for Pen.el. Just load pen-client.el // Bodacious Blog]]

This lets you put basic prompt functions into
your own emacs without loading the whole of
=pen.el=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  (pen-fn-translate/3 (buffer-substring (region-beginning) (region-end)) "English" "French")
#+END_SRC

*** Pen.el full install into your own =.emacs.d=
This is for advanced users, really.

- Install the prerequsites
  - http://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/scripts/setup.sh
  - These instructions are for root and designed for Ubuntu or Debian.
  - It will take more work to get set up.
- Load the example config
  - http://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/src/pen-example-config.el

*** =pen= server (Using the standalone application, =pen=)
=pen= has a standalone application which is an emacs inside docker.
This also functions as a server.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code
  # interact with pen as an editor
  pen /path/to/my-file.txt

  # It can also take stdin
  cat my-file.txt | pen
#+END_SRC

The first time you run =pen=, it will start an emacs daemon inside a docker container.
Subsequent calls to =pen= will use the same container and an =emacsclient=.

Starting the =pen= server with =pen -nw -n=
starts a new =pen= frame with "no window" i.e.
the terminal user interface, and says 'no' to
pulling updates.

Now that it is running, you can also use the bash interop.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code
  penf pf-very-witty-pick-up-lines-for-a-topic/1 slovenia
#+END_SRC

To create a shell into the docker container, simply run =pen sh=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  # From the host, start a shell in the docker container
  pen sh

  # If you want start a specific program (inside the container)
  pen sh vim /
  pen sh nlsh Ubuntu
#+END_SRC

*** Configuration
The Pen configuration consists of a config
file =pen.yaml= and also the =M-x pen-customize= control panel.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  # You may also access pen-customize by running
  # the following on the host or container
  # terminal:
  pen config
#+END_SRC

Some of the values found in =pen.yaml= make their way into =pen-customize=.

I'll explain the following example =pen.yaml= file.

http://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/config/example-pen.yaml

=pen.yaml= lives at =~/.pen/pen.yaml= on the host machine.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml -n :async :results verbatim code

*** =M-SPC= (aka. hyperspace) menu
If you navigate to =pen-define-maps= in http://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/src/pen-example-config.el
You will find the default key bindings.

A bunch of useful prompting functions for code are bound under =M-SPC c=, for example.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  (pen-dk-easy "c l" 'pf-transpile/3)
  
  ;; The above maps the following:
  (progn
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "H-TAB c l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "H-SPC c l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "M-Q c l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "M-u c l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "<H-tab> c l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "M-SPC c l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "M-SPC TAB c l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "M-SPC C-M-i c l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "H-TAB M-c M-l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "H-SPC M-c M-l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "M-Q M-c M-l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "M-u M-c M-l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "<H-tab> M-c M-l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "M-SPC M-c M-l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "M-SPC TAB M-c M-l") 'pf-transpile/3)
    (define-key pen-map (kbd "M-SPC C-M-i M-c M-l") 'pf-transpile/3))
#+END_SRC

The above are all valid ways to access the =hyperspace= menu.

I call it the hyperspace menu because one of the prefixes is =H-SPC=.

=H-= stands for the hyper key. It is invokable in pen with the chord =C-M-\=.

To invoke the right-click context menu, you may use =right-click= or =control-left-click=.

=Control-Left-Click= is needed for the web interface.

*** Use =pen= with the web server
There are a few differences:
- Always runs in terminal mode.
- Right-click doesn't work, so use =Control-Click= instead for the context menu.
- =M-SPC= doesn't work, so use =M-u= instead as a prefix.

*** Use =pen= in gui mode
To get the GUI mode, all you need to do is run
=pen= in a terminal somewhere.

*** Use =pen= in terminal mode
Just add =-nw= to one of your commands, just like running =emacs=.

*** Configuring =pen=
Firstly, there is a =~/.pen= directory on your host machine.

*** Use =lg= in gui mode
There are a couple of configuration options.

- configuration of _force-images_
  - This should generate missing images from alttext
- configuration of _force-text_
  - This should generate missing alttext

***** Use =lg= in terminal mode
*** Do imaginary programming
- http://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/src/ilambda.el

The functions are built into =pen.el=, and so
you can access them from within the =pen=
standalone application.

*** Use =nlsh= (Natural Language Shell)
You may describe the actions you wish to
perform in NL, and =nlsh= will give you the
shell commands.

=nlsh= expects one parameter (the operating
system) and provides you with a REPL.

This allows you to rapidly create a shell that
awaits your NL descriptions and translates
them into real shell commands.
