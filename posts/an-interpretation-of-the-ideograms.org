#+TITLE: An interpretation of the ideograms
#+DATE: <2021-09-15>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: symbology

** Summary
Today I felt like I should try to interpret
the ideograms that make up the semiosis logo.

+ URL :: https://semiosis.github.io/

So I found my way to the linguistics section
of the library and found a book.

I realise that some of these symbols could be
attributed in other ways but this the first
interpretation I have attempted and an
interesting one at that.

- The eclispe (end of a cycle / the world)
  - Cross of Loraine. The first bar represents
  the death of Jesus while the second cross
  bar represents his resurrection and victory.

  - Up-down arrow. Time (Germanic)

  - =#= with square around it

  - The planet Earth, variation.

  - To mix (Alchemy)

The end of a cycle.

** Cross of Lorraine 
The Cross of Lorraine, known as Cross of Anjou
in the 16th century, is a heraldic two-barred
cross, consisting of a vertical line crossed
by two shorter horizontal bars.

The first bar represents the death of Jesus
while the second cross bar represents his
resurrection and victory.
