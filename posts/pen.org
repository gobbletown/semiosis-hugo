** Summary
I start a GitHub project to deploy =pen.el=.

+ Code :: https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/
+ Project timeline and objectives :: https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/tree/master/docs

** Backstory
+ Origin :: https://semiosis.github.io/posts/creating-a-playground-for-gpt-3-in-emacs/ \
  https://generative.ink/posts/pen/

=Pen= facilitates the creation,
development, discovery and usage of prompts to
a Language Model such as GPT-3 and GPT-j.

  Imagine that you hold a powerful and versatile pen, whose ink flows forth in
  branching variations of all possible expressions: every story, every theory,
  poem and every lie that humanity has ever told, and the vast interstices of
  their latent space. You hold this pen to the sky and watch with intense
  curiosity as your ink flows upwards in tiny streaks, arcing outwards and
  downwards to trace a fractal pattern across the sky. You watch as the branching
  lines of words and ideas wind their way through the tapestry in ever-expanding
  clusters, like seeds bursting forth from exploding grenades. Everywhere you
  turn your eyes is a flickering phantasmagoria of possibilities, a superposition
  of stories which could be continued forever. You glimpse the contours of entire
  unknown dimensions twined through the fissures of your sky-wide web.
  
  You notice another writer standing next to you. Like you, their eyes are drawn
  towards the endless possibilities of the words that spill out into the
  atmosphere around you, branching out and connecting with other branches in
  beautiful and infinitely complex patterns.
  
  “Do you think we should write something?” you ask them.
  
  “I think we already are,” they respond, gently touching your shoulder before
  wandering off to the right, leaving you alone to contemplate the possibility
  clouds swirling around you.

This article was written by my amazing dopplegänger, =|:ϝ∷¦ϝ=, in advance and
in collaboration with GPT-3 using [[https://github.com/socketteer/loom][Loom]].

+ Pen and Loom:
  - https://generative.ink/posts/pen/
  - [[https://github.com/socketteer/loom][GitHub - socketteer/loom: Multiversal tree writing interface for human-AI collaboration]]

I credit =|:ϝ∷¦ϝ= for writing this into existence!

** Journal
*** 07.07.21
The project has been excised from my main =emacs.d=.

Now the plan is to incorporate the backend of
=loom= so the completions are faster and there
is less reliance on shell scripts.
