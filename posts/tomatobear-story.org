** Perspective
*** Stories will auto-complete one day
By this, I mean, if I place an incomplete
story on GitHub, this will autocomplete one
day because an AGI will go looking for it,
find it on GitHub and publish the completed
version somewhere, but I can be working on it
now, if I want.

Therefore, I must focus on connecting things
to sources of immutable truth.

*** Journal
**** <2021-06-29 Tue> I have uploaded the story
 I will document the progress of its evolution here.

Conceived as a sculpture by Chen and Milly.

** Tomato Bear
 - avoid allegory and generalisation?

 A tomato is nothing by itself. It needs a bear.

 The tomato bear lives in a world of fake plants. It wasn't always that way.

 There was a time when a bears learned to care for the plants and plant,
 hedgehog and snail would live in harmony.

 The tomato bear is the bearer of a real plant.
 Real plants can philosophize.
 Real plants have a telos.
  the full potential or inherent purpose or objective of a person or thing, similar to the notion of an 'end goal' or 'raison d'Ãªtre'. Moreover, it can be understood as the "supreme end of man's endeavour."
 A real plant dreams of being a plant to its fullest potential and that means ...
 Aside from growing into a fully grown plant, a real plant ...
 Fake plants 

 The tomato bear is the bearer of a tomato... what is special about the tomato over other plants?
 The tomato bear 

 Bears are smaller than tomatoes
 The tomato bear comes from a small village of bears
 The tomato bear has allowed

 There are different types of tomato bears.
 - Cherry tomato
 - Big tomato

 Cherry tomatoes

 An evil creature that created the virus that kills tomatoes. The nihilist 
 The bear is able to keep the tomato alive.
 And in keeping the tomato alive, also its philosophy

 The mushroom people have a mushroom on their heads.
 They are not baddies, but each type of plant has a different philosophy and the mushrooms are very different.

 The mushroom people and mushroom land.

 All plants are good but some of them have
 fallen under the influence of the nihilist
 philosophy and they don't believe as they once
 did and so have started to impose their own
 philosophy onto others?

 The big tomato believes its telos is not to be made into ketchup? -- maybe this is too comical
 The big tomato is very old and wise.

 The big tomato's philosophy

 Bears are very bearish.

 It has caused the cherry tomatoes that once grew in bunches on the ground to divide against themselves.

 Fake plants are a lot like fake 
 - grapes
 - flowers
 They no longer interact with anything.

 The tomato bear visits the bees.
 The bees are about 1/4 the size of the tomato bear and live at the twin hives.
