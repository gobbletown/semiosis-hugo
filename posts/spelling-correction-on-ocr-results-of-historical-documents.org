#+TITLE: Spelling correction on OCR results of historical documents
#+DATE: <2021-09-17>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: gpt codex prompt-of-the-day openai

** Summary
My friend Chen sent me a prompt today. It
takes text which has been interpreted by an
OCR program and outputs text which is likely
inferred.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  This is an example of spelling correction on optical character recognition results of historical
  documents:
  
  OCR Result: r'2Pto flare i~t in the face; for this riea/on they ef~d all tho~-e Books which gave the
  least ac- of the Heathen Theology to the flames ;
  
  Correction: For a to flare it in the face; for this reason they sacrificed all those books which gave
  the least account of the Heathen Theology to the flames;
  
  OCR Result: they continu~e chofep ha~its ~fill in t-he mink .&fen th~at th~e generality of
  Mlankiind conts ing~r them~relv~es with a ju~per~fcial knowvledye th-ingfSif.
  Correction: they continue the same habits till in the midst and even to the end that the generality
  of Mankind content themselves with a superficial knowledge of things.
  
  Correction:

** Results
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  they continued to choose habits that fill
  what they suppose are their basic needs and
  feel that the generality of mankind contains
  in them virtually the same relationship with
  just a superficial knowledge of things.
