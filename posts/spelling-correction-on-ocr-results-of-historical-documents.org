#+TITLE: Prompt of the day: Spelling correction on OCR results of historical documents
#+DATE: <2021-09-17>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: gpt codex

** Summary
My friend Chen sent me a prompt today. It
takes text which has been interpreted by an
OCR program and outputs text which is likely
inferred.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  This is an example of spelling correction on optical character recognition results of historical
  documents:
  
  OCR Result: r'2Pto flare i~t in the face; for this riea/on they ef~d all tho~-e Books which gave the
  least ac- of the Heathen Theology to the flames ;
  
  Correction: For a to flare it in the face; for this reason they sacrificed all those books which gave
  the least account of the Heathen Theology to the flames;
  
  OCR Result: they continu~e chofep ha~its ~fill in t-he mink .&fen th~at th~e generality of
  Mlankiind conts ing~r them~relv~es with a ju~per~fcial knowvledye th-ingfSif.
  Correction: they continue the same habits till in the midst and even to the end that the generality
  of Mankind content themselves with a superficial knowledge of things.
  
  Correction:
