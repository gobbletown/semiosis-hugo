      The following are witty openers for Tinder:

      Tell me three things you have in common with your favorite book character.
      Have you ever swam through an entire book?
      What book had the biggest impact on your life?
      ###

** Further exploration
I wonder if I put the temperature down to 0 if
the pickup lines would all come out autistic.
and if I raised it to 1, the pickup lines
would be super random -- you know crazy girls
might like that.

  Did you know that Hermione Granger wasn’t real, she was just an illusion that you created in order to tell yourself that you didn’t have any hope of living a normal life?

Oh my goodness. I love this.
I'm keeping temperature 1.0. This is me in real life, actually.
