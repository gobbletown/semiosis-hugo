=Examplary= is an example-oriented DSL that can be used to construct and
compose functions based on prompts and external =String->String= commands.

Using examplary, one can keep track of their various =String->String= functions
but also:
- generate prompts from an example generator
- design prompts using design patterns

Here are some examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp -n :i clj :async :results verbatim code
  ;; :g specifies an external [pipable] command which can generate examples or as a source of truth for query reformulation (when generating prompts)
  ;; :i specifies a source of input (training) strings from a jsonl file
  ;; :o specifies an output file for outputting jsonl

  (def lines->regex
    :e "grex"
    "example 1\nexample2" "^example [12]$"
    "example 2\nexample3" "^example [23]$"
    "pi4\npi5" "^pi[45]$")

  (def topic->analogy
    ;; Each line is a training example.
    "Neural networks" "Neural networks are like genetic algorithms in that both are systems that learn from experience"
    "Social media" "Social media is like a market in that both are systems that coordinate the actions of many individuals.")

  (def topic->field-of-study
    "chemistry" "study of chemicals"
    "biology" "study of living things")

  (def cron->natural-language
    :e "interpret-crontab"
    "17 *	* * *" "At minute 17."
    "25 6	* * *" "At 06:25."
    "47 6	* * 7" "At 06:47 on Sunday."
    "52 6	1 * *" "At 06:52 on day-of-month 1.")
