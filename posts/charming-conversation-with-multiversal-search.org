#+TITLE: Charming conversation with multiversal search
#+DATE: <2021-11-23>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: openai pen

** Summary
I add multiversal search to =Pen.el=, to
filter generated conversation candidates for
those which result in constructive/better
responses from the other party.

This way you can avoid stuff-ups in your
conversation.

*** Textual semantic search
+ prompt :: http://github.com/semiosis/prompts/blob/master/prompts/textual-semantic-search-2.prompt

Textual semantic search is the starting point
for filtering text according to semantic predicates.

This also works on the command-line so you can
conveniently perform semantic filtering in
your day-to-day tasks.

*** Multiversal search
The next step is to generate possible
conversation candidates and filter them out
based on downstream responses.

** Next steps
*** Contextual vs semantic similarity
#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code
  echo '["That sounds interesting", "I would love to hear more about that", "Boring."]' |
      "penf" "-u" "pf-textual-semantic-search-filter/2" "what a bored person would say"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src bash
Boring.
#+end_src

Unfortunately, this type of semantic search
works well for only contextual similarity. I
plan on improving semantic similarity though
by running the semantic search twice, given
both a query and a counter-query. Those two
searches yield different likelihoods, and so
I'll do something with that difference.
