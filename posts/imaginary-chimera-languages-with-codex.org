** Summary
I explore some imaginary chimeric languages with Codex.

  The Chimera
  Chimaera
      According to Greek mythology, was a
      monstrous fire-breathing hybrid creature
      of Lycia in Asia Minor, composed of the
      parts of more than one animal.

      It is usually depicted as a lion, with the
      head of a goat protruding from its back,
      and a tail that might end with a snake's
      head.

      The term "chimera" has come to describe
      any mythical or fictional creature with
      parts taken from various animals, to
      describe anything composed of very
      disparate parts, or perceived as wildly
      imaginative, implausible, or dazzling.

*** Definition of =chimeric=
A chimeric language in the context of
"imaginary programming" is one which employs
syntax from 2 or more languages.

=chimerism=, however, is exhibited in other
parts of GPT generations. For example,
generated URLs. Generated URLs are usually not
correct due to chimerism. However, it would be
interesting to generate /imaginary websites/ using
=chimeric URLs=.

Given the following prompt, Codex returned the
following definition:

  Glossary of terms.

  ossified
  Definition: Turn into bone or bony tissue.

  Definition:

  chimeric
      NLG: Program that is not in any way
      written in a language known to the
      programmer.

** scheme + bash
The expressions in this list are all imagined
by Codex. Codex thinks that this is a useful
language. A chimeric language can be made with
any 2 languages or more languages.

  Language: chimera language based on scheme and bash.

** Prompt engineering and imaginary chimeric languages
When designing prompts for Codex ="""= is a
powerful way to delimit fields while
explaining to the LM your task via example.

With the Davinci model, =###= is preferred.
I'm more unsure of where =###= comes (markdown
inpart, perhaps), from but I have some guesses
as to why ="""= is a great delimiter with
Codex.

Python docstrings make use of triple quote.

It is my best guess that the reason ="""= is
such an effective delimiter with prompt
engineering in Codex is that prompts employing
="""= are effectively chimera languages that
are in part 'python docstring' and inspiration
is taken from python docstrings to nudge GPT
in the right way for it to expect effective
delimitation.
