#+TITLE: Imaginary chimera languages with Codex
#+DATE: <2021-09-07>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: codex pen gpt imaginary-programming

** Summary
I explore some imaginary chimera languages with Codex.

** scheme + bash
The expressions in this list are all imagined
by Codex. Codex thinks that this is a useful
language. A chimera language can be made with
any 2 languages or more languages.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Language: chimera language based on scheme and bash.
  File contents:
  ;; String replace is with isnt
  (apply (sed s/is/isnt/) "My name is Shane")
  --> "My name isnt Shane"
  
  (split "\n" (ls))
  --> '("chimera" "chimera.vim" "chimera.vimrc" "install.sh")
  
  (sed 's/chimera/chameleon/' (split "\n" (ls)))
  --> '("chameleon" "chameleon.vim" "chameleon.vimrc" "install.sh")
  
  ;; Get the first field in each string of list using sed
  (mapcar (lambda (str) (apply (sed s/.* //) [str])) '("a b c" "d e f" "d e f"))
  --> ("a" "d" "d")

** Prompt engineering and imaginary chimera languages
When designing prompts for Codex ="""= is a
powerful way to delimit fields while
explaining to the LM your task via example.

With the Davinci model, =###= is preferred.
I'm unsure where =###= comes from but I have
some guesses as to why ="""= is a great
delimiter with Codex.

Python docstrings are make use of triple quote sometimes.

It is my best guess that the reason ="""= is
such an effective delimiter with prompt
engineering in Codex is that prompts employing
="""= are effectively chimera languages that
are in part 'python docstring'.
