  Or, to put it perhaps more plainly, can
  semiosis extend even beyond the world of
  matter and motion, to achieve its effect and
  proper work also in a realm of pure spirits
  bodiless from the start? Can we even conceive
  of a cognitive being that has no body, and yet
  is capable of intellectual understanding
  perforce in the absence of sensations and
  perceptions alike? Would such an intellectual
  activity be semiosic? Can semiosis be
  verified, if only in thought, respecting the
  possible existence of angels?

reminds me of a quote from a book I'm reading right now, "Freedom" by Daniel Suarez

Words have power in this new age. They are not
just sounds. Where ancient people believed in
gods and devils that listened to their pleas
and curses -- in this age immortal entities
hear us. Call them bots or spirits; there is
no functional difference now. They surround
us, and through them word forms become an
unlock code that can trigger a blessing or a
curse. Mankind created systems whose inter-
reactions we could not fully understand, and
the spirits we gathered have escaped ...

  physiosemiosis
      [#Basics of Semiotics]

      Laid down the argument that the action of
      signs extends even further than life, and
      that semiosis as an influence of the
      future played a role in the shaping of the
      physical universe prior to the advent of
      life, a role for which Deely coined the
      term physiosemiosis.

  semiotics
      The study of signs and symbols and their
      use or interpretation.

  zoosemiotics
      The semiotic study of the use of signs
      among animals, more precisely the study of
      semiosis among animals, i.e. the study of
      how something comes to function as a sign
      to some animal.
    
      It is the study of animal forms of
      knowing.

  discourse
      Commonly speaking, the interaction between
      sense and understanding.

  discursive
      [#language]
      [#philosophy]

      Digressing from subject to subject.

      "students often write dull, second-hand,
      discursive prose"

      Relating to discourse or modes of
      discourse.

      "the attempt to transform utterances from
      one discursive context to another"

      The question arises, could an intellectual
      semiosis be possible that did not arise
      out of and have constantly at its disposal
      a perceptual base of cognitive materials
      with which to work?
    
      Since discourse, commonly speaking, is
      precisely this interaction between sense
      and understanding, we are asking whether
      there even can be an intellectual semiosis
      which is not discursive.
    
      Or, to put it perhaps more plainly, can
      semiosis extend even beyond the world of
      matter and motion, to achieve its effect
      and proper work also in a realm of pure
      spirits bodiless from the start?

      [#semiotics]

      The "biological foundations that lie at
      the very epicenter of the study of both
      communication and signification in the
      human [and non-human] animal".

      The term is usually translated as "self-
      centered world".

  Semiotics
  semiotic studies
      The study of sign process (semiosis).

      It includes the study of signs and sign
      processes, indication, designation,
      likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy,
      metaphor, symbolism, signification, and
      communication.

      It is not to be confused with the
      Saussurean tradition called semiology,
      which is a subset of semiotics.

      The semiotic tradition explores the study
      of signs and symbols as a significant part
      of communications.

      Different from linguistics, semiotics also
      studies non-linguistic sign systems.
