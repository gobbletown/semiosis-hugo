** Summary
I take AlephAlpha's multimodal LM for a spin
to see how well it does surreal art
interpretation.

*** My description
In this surreal artwork, flowers confidently stand from the sawn-off head of a
ceramic mannequin. Water endlessly surfaces
from the neck and quietly overflows from the lip. The arms
and hands delicately embrace each other with attention towards to beholder in a sign of defencelessness and trust. The offering is attention, beauty and conversation.
A dichotomy of insecurity with innocence is outweighed by confidence.

*** Continuations
=Furthermore,= (temperature=0.0 i.e. fully deterministic)
the flowers are a symbol of the human soul.

=Furthermore,= (temperature=0.1)
the flowers are a symbol of life and growth.

=Furthermore,= (temperature=0.3)
the flowers are a symbol of the human soul and the human spirit.

=Furthermore,= (temperature=0.8)
a subtle harmonization of the positive and negative sides seems to resonate in this simple and yet sophisticated work of art.

*** Questions
- Who does this person represent?
- Is this an accurate description?
- What else could be said about the mannequin?
- What types of flowers are there?

*** My interpretation
/*Theory 1: dark chimera*/
A girl believes she must prepare for her photo
to be taken. So she wears a low cut, frilly
garment, and splays her fiery red hair, which
she put great effort into, and she is so proud
of. She poses for the viewer so they can see.

She doesn't know that she is actually an
intelligent canvas, which genuinely believes
it is a girl, but is unable to look back on
its own face, and so has no idea that it needs
to construct one. As observers, we can see it
for what it really is.

The canvas is a dark chimera which survives by
believing it is real and has a purpose. One
day it thinks it's a girl, but the next a cat.

/*Theory 2: hasty ouroboros*/
The effort she placed in hair reveals that she
is a person, and the entity that removes her
face was not in her control.

In a race against time, she prepares her hair,
and positions herself for the meaning of her
life.

And this is the moment after the black entity
of the canvas began to redact her, starting
with her face.

Her hair, she hopes will be like a flag in battle, defiant to the last moment.
But she has no idea that the enemy is actually herself and is she in a continual cycle of rebirth and transformation.
