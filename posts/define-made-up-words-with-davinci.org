** Demo
*** Correct definitions

I like this one:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  marked by the secretive nature of
  surrealism.
  Â  (surrealeptitious)
  "the surrealeptitious art of collage"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  marked by an apparently incongruous
  combination of circumstances or events
  that seem to be deliberately contrary to
  what one expects; bizarre; uncanny.
  "it was a dark and stormy night that
  might have served as the setting for
  surrealeptitious meeting of the two old
  friends"
#+END_SRC

*** Too much surreptitious; Not enough surreal
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Lacking subtlety, especially in a way that is
  embarrassing.
  "The movie was full of surrealeptitious product
  placement"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  marked by the intentional use of strategies
  intended to mislead or confuse, as for the
  purpose of political or military deception.
  "his death was due to surrealeptitious poisoning"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  secret and crafty
  "a conspiracy of surrealeptitious Watergate
  burglars"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  An act usually in violation of the law,
  the truth, or morality, done in secret or
  with the permission or cooperation of
  an authority.
  "Rayburn's surrealeptitious intervention
  tipped the balance in favor of the
  railroads."
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  an underhanded and usually devious
  method; sly and secret ; (devious)
  "he resorted to surrealeptitious tactics"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  highly secret and mysterious
  "a surrealeptitious glance at his watch"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  So subtle as to escape notice.
  "the surrealeptitious sound of their
  footsteps"
#+END_SRC
