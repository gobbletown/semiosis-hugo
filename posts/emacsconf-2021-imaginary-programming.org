** Abstract:
Imaginary Programming (=IP=) is both methodology and paradigm. It is an extension
of literate programming and a way of creating software without the use of
imperative, functional or even declarative code. Yet IP employs all disciplines
to achieve the miraculous. The only contingency is on one or more language
models, known as foundation models. The real value of IP is not
found by abandoning sound logic altogether, but in weaving the real with the
imaginary. The future of imaginary programming is one in which almost all of
computing is inferred. I have built a suite of tools based on emacs for
interfacing real programming languages with imaginary ones; all of this in
order to demonstrate what I mean; a 'complex' terminal that lets you imagine
what happens no matter how nested you are within interpreters, an example-oriented
language, a file format that encodes the provenance of text and a library for
imaginary functional programming primitives called iLambda. It is important to
recognise IP because, for lack of a better term, it has far-reaching implications for
intellectual property and the GPL. Please keep an open mind.
