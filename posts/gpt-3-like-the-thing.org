#+TITLE: GPT-3 is The Thing
#+DATE: <2021-04-14 Wed>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: gpt-3 gpt openai

** Summary
The Thing is a lot like GPT-3 due to it being extremely capable, but limited to the queries you give it.

It's as powerful as your understanding on how to talk to it.

The Thing is a black box computer in the =nomes= series by Terry Pratchett.

I make reference to the first book in the series =Truckers=.

This book is freely available on the Internet Archive.

I remember watching the start of this movie
when I was very young. The movie was taped
over so I only saw first 10 minutes of it, but
the memory stuck since it was so unusual.

      It means there's always something you should have done first. For example, if
      you want to build a house you need to know how to make bricks, and before you
      can make bricks you need to know what kind of clay to use. And so on.'

** Asking GPT-3 about "The Thing"
*** Ask the oracle
#+NAME: question
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  What is the flight computer referred to as "The Thing" in the novel "Truckers" by Terry Prachett?
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code :inb question
  xa upd openai-complete oracle-answer-question
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src bash
 The flight computer is a small, black box that controls the flight of the
 spaceship. It is also referred to as the "Thing" because it is the only thing
 that can be used to control the spaceship.

The Thing is the computer onboard the giant spaceship "ScreeWee" and it has a very advanced artificial intelligence onboard.

#+RESULTS:

You may not remember them as they have been
absent from recent literature. The ScreeWee
are a race of alien beings who are at war with
the humans because of the ScreeWee's lack of
resources in water or land. There is a small
part of the novel, however, that talks about
how the humans are not allowed to attack the
ScreeWee until they have been declared
hostiles. This is because of a treaty that was
signed several centuries earlier.

** Excerpts from Truckers
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  'I think it wants us to tell it what to do,' said Masklin. He sat back on his heels
  and watched the lights.
  
  What can you do?' he said.
  
  'I can translate, calculate, triangulate, assimi-late, -correlate and extrapolate.'
  
  'I don't think we want anything like that,' said Masklin. 'Do we want anything
  like that?' he asked the others.
  
  Granny Morkie appeared to think about it. 'No,' she said eventually, 'I don't
  think we wants any of that stuff. Another banana'd be nice, mind.'

*'I can translate, calculate, triangulate, assimi-late, -correlate and extrapolate.'*

  We have the Thing,' he said. 'It will show us the Way, it will.'

  Masklin nodded gloomily. Funny how Torrit always knew what the Thing
  wanted. It was just a black square thing, but it had some very defi-nite ideas
  about the importance of regular meals and how you should always listen to what
  the old folk said. It seemed to have an answer for every-thing.

  'And where does this Way take us?' said Masklin.

  'You knows that well enough. To the Heavens.'

  'Oh. Yes,' said Masklin. He glared at the Thing. He was pretty certain that it
  didn't tell old Torrit anything at all; he knew he had pretty good hear-ing, and he
  never heard it say anything. It never did anything, it never moved. The only
  thing it ever did was look black and square. It was good at that.

  'Only by followin' the Thing closely in all par-ticulars can we be sure of going
  to the Heavens,' said Torrit, uncertainly, as if he'd been told this a long time ago
  and hadn't understood it even then.

  'Yes, well,' said Masklin. He stood up on the swaying floor and made his way to
  the tarpaulin.

  Then he paused to screw up his courage and poked his head under the gap.

  There- was nothing but blurs and lights,. and strange smells.

  It was-all going wrong. It had seemed so sensible that night, a week ago.
  Anything was better than here. That seemed so obvious then. But it was odd.
  The old ones moaned like anything when things weren't exactly to their liking
  but now, when everything was looking bad, they were almost cheerful.

  People were a lot more complicated than they looked. Perhaps the Thing could
  tell you that, too, if you knew how to ask.

  'I will use small words,' said the Thing. 'I am the Flight Recording and
  Navigation Computer. A computer is a machine that thinks. Think, computer,
  think. See the computer think. I use elec- tricity. Sometimes elec-tricity can carry
  mess-ages. I can hear the messages. I can understand the messages. Sometimes
  the messages go along wires called telephone wires. Sometimes they are in other
  computers. There is a computer in the Store. It pays humans their wages. I can
  hear it think.

  The old man was sitting very still, with the Thing on his lap, staring at nothing.
  
  He paid them no attention when they came in. Once or twice his fingers
  drummed on the Thing's black surface.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  'Yes. Have you spoken to this, this thing?' The Thing? Well, in a way.
  
  It talks funny, though. It's hard to understand.'
  
  'It has talked to me. It has told me it was made by nomes, a long time ago. It eats
  electric. It says it can hear electric things. It has said-' he glared at the thing in
  his lap '-it has said that it has heard Arnold Bros (est. 1905) plans to demolish
  the Store. It is a mad thing, it talks about stars, it says we came from a star,
  flying. But..
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  And so he smiled, and nodded, and listened, and fell asleep as the Thing
  talked and talked and talked...
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  And the generations had passed by, and the nomes forgot everything except that
  the Thing was very important.

  'The Thing told me,' said Masklin. 'It's some-thing called critical path analysis.
  It means there's always something you should have done first. For example, if
  you want to build a house you need to know how to make bricks, and before you
  can make bricks you need to know what kind of clay to use. And so on.'

  'The Thing's a sort of thinking machine, isn't it? That's what Dorcas said. Well,
  machines say exactly what they mean, don't they?'

  It seemed the only time nomes acted together
  was when they had something to occupy their
  minds Beyond the moon, the Thing had said. You
  used to live in the stars.
  
  Masklin lay back and listened to the bees.
  
  One day we'll go back. We'll find a way to get
  to the big ship in the sky, and we'll go back.
  But not yet. It'll take some doing, and the
  hard part again will be getting people to
  understand. Every time we climb up a step we
  settle down and think we've got to the top of
  the stairs, and start bickering about things.
