#+TITLE: Book review with Codex
#+DATE: <2021-10-12>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: emacs openai codex

** Summary
I make a prompt which generates summaries of
books, based on what the LM has read.

*** Question
How are results weighted roughly you think? If
results are weighted hugely popularity like in
search engines then it would be hard for
openAI to generate or create anything beyond
the general consensus?

*** Answer
when it comes to very popular books, you're
probably correct. 'how' is an incredibly
difficult question to answer. misinformation
can easily sneak into the results. the prompt
is designed to be inspired by book reviews,
because i placed a url at the top of it that
looks like it's from a website that contains
book reviews, so the review will be skewed
towards popular opinion like you say,
probably, but inevitably will also factor in
from other sources, including non-related or
similarly looking material

as for the technique that openai used to
summarize the book, that's very different.
that actually makes a synopsis based on mostly
unbias summarization

*** The Hunting of the Snark
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  "The Hunting of the Snark" is a short
  children's novel by the British author Lewis
  Carroll.
  
  A popular children's story, it is about a
  journey taken by the protagonist, an English
  navigation captain, in search of a probable
  adventure.
  
  During this journey, he is accompanied by
  aortal creatures known as the "Brummles", who
  are able to share the same physical space in
  an apparently telepathic manner.
  
  It is also a parody of "Journey's End" by
  Emily Dickinson, which is itself a parody of
  "The Hunting of the Snark".

** Crtique of pure reason - Immanuel Kant
*** Result 1
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  A demystifying text on major work of modern
  philosophy.
  
  Written in 1781, but with many later
  additions, it attempts to systematize the main
  argument of the previous century.
  
  Never intended to be published, it was
  intended to guide the German philosophical
  professors of the epoch.
  
  However, its wide citations in the modern
  analytic philosophy of the West have made it
  one of the most famous documents of modern
  philosophy.
#+END_SRC

*** Result 2
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Kant presents a transcendental deduction of
  synthetic a priori truths.
  
  The work founded the tradition of critical
  philosophy and paved the way to German
  idealism.
  
  Based on previous philosophical thinking, his
  first major work, The Critique of Pure Reason
  (1781) developed arguments for idealism
  regarding the relationship between the human
  reason and the world.
  
  He argued that the source of all our knowledge
  is the faculty of understanding, that through
  intuition the human mind receives the
  fundamental concepts of space, time,
  causation, and necessity, which are the source
  of all empirical knowledge.
  
  He also explored other parts of his
  philosophy, including his arguments for the
  synthetic a priori nature of geometry, his
  views on the relations between the knowing
  subject
#+END_SRC

*** Result 3
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  The Critique of Pure Reason (hereafter
  referred to simply as the Critique) is perhaps
  the most complex, profound, and inaccessible
  work in the history of metaphysical
  philosophy.
  
  The entire work comprises two parts (the first
  of which is treated in this volume).
  
  The first part contains three "dialogues" (or,
  more properly, "questions") in which the
  author seeks to prove the three "fundamental"
  metaphysical ideas (categories of
  understanding, ideas of reason, and synthetic
  a priori truths) that are necessary for any
  knowledge of objects a priori, i.e., for any
  knowledge that is not given solely in and
  through the senses.

  In her stunningly beautiful d√©but novel,
  Elizabeth Strout takes a truth universally
  acknowledged: a poor young woman's chances of
  making a good life for herself are nearly
  nonexistent.
  
  But in a small town in upstate New York during
  the 1960s, Ann Leckie seems to have more than
  the sum of what most people are given.
  
  Ann is cheerfully beautiful, available, smart,
  and hardworking.
  
  Prettiness, in fact, is her best quality, and
  she knows it.
  
  So when she wins a scholarship to a boarding
  school, she thinks she has a real chance to
  make a better life for herself.

  Anything is Possible captures the power of
  possibility -- that is, the idea that nothing
  is certain, and that life always gives us a
  new shot.
  
  It is the story of two young girls -- Lia, a
  scrapper from the Boston projects, and her
  older sister Em, an up-and-coming lawyer whose
  potential is limited -- who find each other
  and form an unlikely friendship.
  
  Lia's father walked out on her family, leaving
  them to survive on social security and their
  wits.
  
  Em's father is in jail, possibly unjustly, and
  she has few opportunities for work.
  
  They are not supposed to be friends.
  
  They are supposed to be kind to each other.
