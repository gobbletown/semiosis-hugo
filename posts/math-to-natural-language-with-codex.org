** Summary
I make a prompt which translates math into NL,
and states what area of math it comes from.

  P is a proposition that Roofus is a mammal. P(x) is a proposition that x is a mammal. Q is a proposition that every dog is a mammal. (Predicate calculus)
  P is a sentence that defines a property, P(x) is a sentence that defines a property of x (Predicate calculus)
  P is a statement, P(x) is a predicate, and Q is a statement that is true for every x in the domain (Predicate calculus)
  P is a sentence that is true for all x in the domain, Q is a sentence that is true for all x in the domain, such that P(x) is true (Predicate calculus)
