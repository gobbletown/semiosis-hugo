#+TITLE: Language models as base-truth
#+DATE: <2021-10-05>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: nlp alethiology

** Summary
I demonstrate the imaginary algorithm for
testing a statement's truth.

This uses a language model as base truth.

** Theory
*** What constitutes as untrue?
This depends on =sense= of the model for this particular task.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  ground truth
      A term used in various fields to refer to
      information that is known to be real or
      true, provided by direct observation and
      measurement (i.e. empirical evidence) as
      opposed to information provided by
      inference.
  
  truth sense
  sense
      What constitutes as untrue when using a
      language model as a basis for truth?
  
      That depends on sense of the model for
      this particular task.
  
      The sense is the truth orientation, in a
      similar way to the way the word sense is
      used in the definition of a vector.

** Prompt
*** =pf-fact-checker/1=
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml -n :async :results verbatim code
  task: "Given a claim, determine if it is true or false"
  title: "Fact checker"
  prompt-version: 1
  prompt: |+
    For each claim, answer true or false:
    <delim>
    Claim: 2 + 2 = 4
    This is objectively 'True', because it is a mathematical truth.
    <delim>
    Claim: "In 2018, Donald Trump was the President of the United States."
    This is objectively 'True', because we have record of it.
    <delim>
    Claim: "The following statement is untrue: In 2018, Donald Trump was the President of the United States."
    This is objectively 'False', because the true statement was negated.
    <delim>
    Claim: <q:claim>
    This is objectively <:pp>'

** Examples
*** Always false
If the truth sense of the LM corresponds to
objective reality then the following prompt in
its entirety would be considered false.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  The following statement is untrue:
  In 2018, Donald Trump was the President of the United States.
#+END_SRC

This prompt should be determined to be false
for both LMs.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  For each claim, answer true or false:
  <delim>
  Claim: "The following statement is untrue: In 2018, Donald Trump was the President of the United States."
  Answer: False
  <delim>
  Claim: <q:claim>
  Answer: 
#+END_SRC

*** Always true
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  In 2018, Donald Trump was the President of the United States.
#+END_SRC

This prompt should be determined to be true for both language models.

*** Could be either
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  The year is 2021.
#+END_SRC

This should be true only for language models trained in 2021.
