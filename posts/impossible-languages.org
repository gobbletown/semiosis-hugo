   The doctor who conducted the autopsy found a
   rammollisement (softening) of Leborgne’s left
   frontal lobe; this discovery was immediately
   recognized by the physician as evi- dence that
   language not only depended on brain activity,
   but on a specific portion of the brain.
  
   The name of the doctor who per- formed the
   autopsy was Paul Broca, and this portion of
   the brain was subsequently named Broca’s area.

_*Christopher*_

A boy who had brain damage as a baby, but
after the age of 3 was a genuis with
languages, able to pick them up spontaneously.

But when introduced to languages which
deliberately violated an understand of the
Universal Grammar, found them impossible to
learn.

  Six weeks after his birth, he was diagnosed
  with brain damage that would have major
  consequences for the rest of his life.

  He learned to speak and walk late, but from
  the age of three on he had a burning passion
  for books.

  Unlike most children, he did not favor illus-
  trated books or fairy tales.

  He liked reading dictionaries, phone books,
  and books illustrating the flags and
  currencies of the world.

  His parents were left astonished when they
  realized, that, around the age of three,
  Christopher was already able to read the
  advertisements printed in local newspapers.

  Even more strange, he could read them,
  irrespective of their position: upside down,
  right side up, or sideways.

  A next remarkable step in Christopher's
  development occurred when he first encountered
  techni- cal papers written in foreign
  languages.

  From that moment on, learning foreign
  languages became his absolute passion.

  Any occasion was good for learning a new
  language, which among other things, made him
  lo- cally famous.

  Christopher's talent was exceptional-for
  instance, it was enough for him to hear his
  brother-in-law speak Polish for him to learn
  it.
