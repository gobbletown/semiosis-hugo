#+KEYWORDS: gpt pen openai eleutherai emacs

** Summary
I add support for EleutherAI's GPT-j model via
https://apps.aixsolutionsgroup.com/.

Get yourself a key from the link above if you'd like to try it out.

To try this out, firstly follow the setup instructions here:
- https://mullikine.github.io/posts/pen-tutorial/

To update / remove the keys at any time, use
the following key bindings.

| kb    | f                    |                              |
|-------+----------------------+------------------------------|
| =M-o= | =pen-add-key-openai= | =pen-acolyte-minor-mode-map= |
| =M-a= | =pen-add-key-aix=    | =pen-acolyte-minor-mode-map= |

If you remove one of the keys then Pen will
attempt to use the other engine.

Prompts may still prefer a given engine.

Learn to write prompt description files here:
- https://github.com/semiosis/prompts/

=Pen.el= supports arbitrary backends and takes
care of prompt engine preferences and your own
preferences (local(private), libre and commercial).
